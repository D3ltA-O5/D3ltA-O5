# 🌟 Howdy! I'm D3ltA_O5

I'm currently developing plugins for **SCP: Secret Laboratory** using **EXILED**. If you're interested in SCP:SL plugins, feel free to check out my repositories below:

## 📦 SCP:SL Plugins
- [🔫 Infinite Ammo](https://github.com/D3ltA-O5/Infinite_Ammo): A plugin that provides players with infinite ammunition for endless battles.
- [🎁 RoundStart Item Giver](https://github.com/D3ltA-O5/RoundStart_ItemGiver): Automatically gives items to players at the start of each round.
- [🔥 RoundEnding Friendly Fire](https://github.com/D3ltA-O5/RoundEnding_FF): Enables friendly fire at the end of each round for added chaos and fun.
- [💀 Suicide Command](https://github.com/D3ltA-O5/Suicide_Command): Adds `.suicide` and `.kill` commands for self-elimination during the game.

Yes, I support and update these plugins

You can also offer me an idea for a plugin that is required for your project and maybe I will create it (。・ω・。)
